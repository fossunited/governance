# FOSS United Governing Board Charter [Early Draft]

The elected representatives of the FOSS United Governing Board (hereafter referred to as GB),
shall be the primary body responsible for guiding and overseeing the activities of the FOSS United
Community. The GB is elected to provide support to and strengthen the Community. It shall define
and aim to ensure alignment with the goals for the FOSS United Community.

This charter aims to outline all the responsibilities and guidelines for how the GB shall
operate.

## Mission, Vision, and Values

### Governance Structure

The Board shall consist of five  members, all of whom shall be elected through an open and fair
election process.

GB meetings shall be required to follow quorum to enable a fair voting process for all
matters brought forward for the consideration of the Board.

Members of the GB may not be allowed to name or nominate representatives to attend as an
alternate.

The GB may invite guests to participate in consideration of specific topics (but such guests
may not participate in any voting matters).

Primary activities of the GB shall be, but not limited to:
* vote on all decisions or matters coming before the GB; and
* approve procedures for the nomination and election of any representative of the Community
  to the GB and any Officer or other positions created by the GB; and
* oversee all FOSS United Foundation and Community activities, and potentially work with the appropriate
  legal help on any legal matters that arise; and
* adopt and maintain policies or rules and procedures for the various operational policies of
  FOSS United

## Quorum rules

Quorum for GB meetings will require at least 50 percent of the voting representatives.

The GB may continue to meet even if quorum is not met, upon sufficient notice being given in
advance, but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

Consensus, for purposes of GB voting, shall be defined as the lack of sustained objection. If,
however, any decision requires a vote to move forward, the GB, as applicable, will vote on a
one vote per voting representative basis. All decisions shall be expected to arise from consensus
within the GB.

In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that cannot be resolved by the GB,
employee representatives of FOSS United shall be asked to step in and help resolve the
situation.

## Governing Board Composition:

* The GB will be composed of 5 members.
* Each member will be elected to a two-year term.
* There will be an annual election to determine the composition of the GB for the following year.
  Two seats will be up for election every year.
* Employees from the same company or related companies* should not hold more than 1 GB seat.

Additional clauses:
* During any GB election, if the GB membership would exceed this limit even after the
  natural cycle of GB seat term expirations, enough GB members must resign for it to be
  possible for the election to yield a diverse enough GB.
* If a round of GB election cannot produce a diverse enough GB, the limit will not apply
  until the next election cycle.
* When a change in employment of a GB member causes their GB membership to exceed this
  limit, that GB member will be required to resign their GB membership.
* GB members can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms.

## Amendments

The process for amending or modifying the Governing Board charter begins with the submission of an Amendment
Proposal. Any community member is welcome to propose changes, which must be submitted in writing
via an [email](mailto:governing-board@fossunited.org) to the GB. Each proposal
should clearly outline the specific changes and provide a rationale for why these changes are necessary.

Once a proposal is received, the “Amendments Committee”, comprising FOSS United Foundation Staff
and the GB will make it public and review it within 30 days. During this period, the committee may
seek additional input from the Community to ensure a thorough evaluation. Following the review,
the proposed amendments will be published on the Community’s official communication channels,
inviting feedback. A 30-day feedback period will be provided, allowing community members
to express their support, concerns, or suggestions.

After the feedback period concludes, the Amendments Committee will convene to discuss the proposal
and the community’s input. For any amendment or modification to be approved, it must receive a
two-thirds majority vote from the GB.

Once approved, the amendments will be documented and incorporated into the charter. The updated
charter will then be published publicly and communicated to all members.

In cases where immediate changes are necessary for the safety, security, or legal compliance of
the project, the GB has the authority to enact temporary amendments. These emergency amendments will
be subject to the standard review and approval process within 60 days to ensure they are properly
vetted and ratified.

## Code of Conduct

## Dispute Resolution

## Elections

* Elections will be held every year in the month of March
* An Elections Working Group (WG) will be constituted by the first week of December every year
* The Elections WG will comprise one member of the GB, one member of the Foundation,
  and one independent member from the FOSS United Community. Preferably, the tenure
  of the GB member of the Elections WG ends with the upcoming election,
  and they aren't contesting in the upcoming election. The independent member from the
  Community could be one of the candidates who lost the previous election cycle and isn't
  contesting in the upcoming election
* The Elections WG will announce the schedule for the upcoming elections by the first week of
  January every year
* Along with the election schedule, the Elections WG will also determine the structure of the
  nomination form, i.e., the personal/professional information that a nominee needs to provide,
  and the questions that the nominee will need to fill in
* The Elections WG will solicit nominations from FOSS United and the broader Indian FOSS Community.
  The Election WG can reach out to individuals and request that they consider running for election.
  The Election WG will reach out to the Indian FOSS community and the FOSS United Community by
  working with the Foundation staff and Community volunteers, e.g., newsletter, social media posts, etc
* The Election WG will delist incomplete nomination forms and announce the final list of
  nominees to the Community
* The Election WG will freeze the voter rolls when the final list of nominees is announced
* A two-week+ voting period will be adopted, similar to the
  [Open Street Map Foundation](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Annual_General_Meetings/2024/Voting_Information_and_Instructions#Voting_duration)
  and the [Python Software Foundation](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/07/the-2024-psf-board-election-is-open.html).
  The voting period will open on a Saturday at 00:00 hours and it will end on a Sunday at 23:59 hours
* Thanks to online voting, the Election WG will announce the results of the election within one day.
  Ballots will be shared electronically in a public forum, without any personally identifiable information.
  Please see [Appendix](#how-are-votes-counted) to understand the method by which votes will be counted
* The Election WG will solicit feedback about the election cycle for a period of one month after
  the election. After consolidating the feedback and providing it to the Community, the WG will disband

### History

Please see the evolution of the Governing Board exercise on the FOSS United Forum post -
[Electing a FOSS United Governing board forum topic](https://forum.fossunited.org/t/electing-a-fossunited-governing-board/3569).

### How are votes counted

The FOSS United Community is expected to rank the nominees from 1 to 5 in their ballot.
The [Single Transferrable Vote (STV)](https://opavote.com/methods/single-transferable-vote) method will then
be used to count the votes to determine the makeup of the Governing Board. Specifically,
the [Scottish STV](https://opavote.com/methods/single-transferable-vote#scottish-stv) or
[Meek STV](https://opavote.com/methods/single-transferable-vote#meek-stv) methods will be used to count the votes.
Please note that the [Open Street Map Foundation uses the Scottish STV method](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Annual_General_Meetings/2024/Voting_Information_and_Instructions)
to count the votes for their elections.

Please find explainers about STV in [this video by CGP Grey](https://youtu.be/l8XOZJkozfI?si=vnPZsK5pW24e3tvX)
and in this video by [the Washington Post](https://youtu.be/2crVSDqHGYY?si=UnaU2eqxAO3g16Sv).
