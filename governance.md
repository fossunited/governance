# FOSS United Governing Board Charter [Early Draft]

Please see the [Electing a FOSS United Governing board forum topic](https://forum.fossunited.org/t/electing-a-fossunited-governing-board/3569)
for additional context.

The elected representatives of the FOSS United Governing Board (hereafter refered to as Board),
shall be the primary body responsible for guiding and overseeing the activities of the FOSS United
Community. The Board is elected to provide support to and strengthen the Community. It shall aim
to ensure alignment with the goals set out by FOSS United.

This charter aims to outline all the responsibilities and guidelines for how the Board shall
operate.

## Mission, Vision, and Values

Governance Structure
The Board shall consist of three members, all of whom shall be elected through an open and fair
election process.

Board meetings shall be required to follow quorum in order to enable a fair voting process for all
matters brought forward for the consideration of the Board.

Members of the Board may not be allowed to name or nominate representatives to attend as an
alternate.

The Board may invite guests to participate in consideration of specific topics (but such guests
may not participate in any voting matters).

The Board meetings will be open and public, unless decided otherwise by the Board, in conjunction
with FOSS United employees(?).

Primary activities of the Board shall be, but not limited to:
* vote on all decisions or matters coming before the Board; and
* approve procedures for the nomination and election of any representative of the City Chapters
  to the Board and any Officer or other positions created by the Board; and
* oversee all FOSS United business and community outreach matters and work with the appropriate
  legal help on any legal matters that arise; and
* adopt and maintain policies or rules and procedures for the various operational policies of
  FOSS United

## Quorum rules

Quorum for Board meetings will require at least 50 percent of the voting representatives.

The Board may continue to meet even if quorum is not met, upon sufficient notice being given in
advance, but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

Consensus, for purposes of Board voting, shall be defined as the lack of sustained objection. If,
however, any decision requires a vote to move forward, the representatives of the Governing Board
or Committee, as applicable, will vote on a one vote per voting representative basis. All
decisions shall be expected to arise from consensus within the Board.

In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that cannot be resolved by the Governing
Board, employee representatives of FOSS United(?) shall be asked to step in and help resolve the
situation.

## Board Composition:

* The Board will be composed of 3 members.
* Each member will be elected to a two-year term.
* There will be an annual election to determine the composition of the TOC for the following year.
  For the first year alone, _____ (60%) seats will be up for election in one year and two will be
  up for election the following year.
* Employees from the same company or related companies* should not hold more than 1 Board seats.

Additional clauses:
* During any Board election, if the Board membership would exceed this limit even after the
  natural cycle of Board seat term expirations, enough Board members must resign for it to be
  possible for the election to yield a diverse enough Board.
* If a round of Board election cannot produce a diverse enough Board, the limit will not apply
  until the next election cycle.
* When a change in employment of a Board member causes their Board membership to exceed this
  limit, that Board member will be required to resign their TOC membership.

## Amendments

The process for amending or modifying this charter begins with the submission of an Amendment
Proposal. Any community member is welcome to propose changes, which must be submitted in writing
(where, TBD - GitHub Issue? Google docs? Email? Forum submission? etc) to the governance
committee. Each proposal should clearly outline the specific changes and provide a rationale for
why these changes are necessary.

Once a proposal is received, the “Amendments Committee”, comprising of FOSS United members
(chosen specifically, GB) will review it within 30 days. During this period, the committee may
seek additional input from the community to ensure a thorough evaluation. Following the review,
the proposed amendments will be published on the project’s official communication channels,
inviting community feedback. An n-day feedback period will be provided, allowing community members
to express their support, concerns, or suggestions.

After the feedback period concludes, the governance committee will convene to discuss the proposal
and the community’s input. For any amendment or modification to be approved, it must receive a
two-thirds majority vote from the governance committee.

Once approved, the amendments will be documented and incorporated into the charter. The updated
charter will then be published on the project’s official repository and communicated to all
members.

In cases where immediate changes are necessary for the safety, security, or legal compliance of
the project, the governance committee has the authority to enact temporary amendments. These
emergency amendments will be subject to the standard review and approval process within 60 days to
ensure they are properly vetted and ratified.
